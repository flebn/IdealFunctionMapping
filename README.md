# IdealFunctionMapping

IdealFunctionMapping provides a structured approach to map test data to ideal functions with efficient data 
handling, accurate calculations, and clear visualizations. The project structure and unit tests contribute to 
maintainable and reliable code. By following the installation instructions, users can easily set up the program on 
their local machines and benefit from its functionality.

## Features

- Loads training data, ideal functions, and test data from CSV files.
- Stores the data in an SQLite database for efficient processing.
- Calculates deviations and determines the best fit functions based on the training data.
- Maps the test data to the chosen ideal functions based on deviation criteria.
- Visualizes the training data and potentially other relevant data.
- Provides unit tests for the main components of the program.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11
- Required packages (see `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/IdealFunctionMapping.git
```

2. Change to the project directory:
```bash
cd IdealFunctionMapping
```

3. Install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The requirements.txt file lists the required packages and their versions to ensure consistent environments and easy installation on other systems. The program uses popular Python libraries such as pandas, pytest, sqlalchemy, plotly, and tabulate to handle data, perform calculations, visualize results, and conduct unit tests. These libraries offer robust functionalities and are widely used in the data science and visualization community.
## Usage
1. Place your training data in a CSV file named training_data.csv.
2. Place your ideal functions in a CSV file named ideal_functions.csv.
3. Place your test data in a CSV file named test_data.csv.
4. Execute the main program:
```bash
python main.py
```
5. View the output and visualizations generated by the program.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- data/: Contains modules for data handling.
- functions/: Contains modules for ideal and regression functions and modules related to data mapping.
- visualization/: Contains modules for data visualization.
- tests/: Contains unit test modules to verify the correctness of the main components of the program.
- main.py: Serves as the entry point of the program, where the main logic is executed.
- README.md: Contains project documentation and details about the installation, usage, and other relevant information.
- requirements.txt: Lists the required Python packages and their versions to ensure consistent environments and easy 
installation on other systems.

This structured approach helps maintain code organization, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the functionality of the IdealFunctionMapping program.

## Unit tests
The project includes unit tests for the main components. To run the tests, use the following command:
```bash
pytest
```
